# EDA-on-INDIAN-EDUCATION-SYSTEM

In this project we are going to analyze the Indian Education System. Main focus of this analysis will be on The Enrollment and Dropout Ratio of Schools over the years. We also try find out if there is any correlation between basic amneties in school (water, electricity etc.) and the enrollment/dropout ratios. Indian education System is divided into four main parts.

1) Primary : The Primary Education in India consists of students studying in Class I-IV.

2) Upper Primary: The Upper Primary Education in India consists of students studying in Class V-VIII.The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education (Class I-VIII) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old.

3) Secondary: Secondary education in India begins after eight years of elementary education and is divided into two years of secondary education (classes IX and X) and two years of Higher secondary education (classes XI and XII)

4) Higher Secondary: Higher Secondary Education consists of students studying in Class XI & XII.

Gross Enrollment Ratio: Number of students enrolled in a given level of education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the official school-age population corresponding to the same level of education.

Dropout Ratio : The percentage of students failing to complete a particular school or college course.

The Indian government has took many steps to increase the enrollment ratio of students . Steps like Right to Education Policy for primary school students.The government also runs "Go to school Campaign" to motivate young students to attend regular classes.
